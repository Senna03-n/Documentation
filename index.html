        The core values guiding this project were immersion and hierarchy. Immersion was achieved through ayered sensory design. While visual elements, like the dark palette and the eyes, provide surface-level atmosphere, the audio foundation creates psychological depth. The ambient sound of the forest creates a drone of low-frequency rumble to make it feel like it is everywhere. This is not music, it is about the presence of the environment. The human brain is very sensitive to low frequencies, which is why this rumble creates primal unease without the user's conscious awareness. That dissonance is intentional, making the experience feel uncanny rather than comfortable. This adds to the belief that the experience feels like it is inhabited rather than just observed. Moreover, a dark gradient aesthetic, and a deliberate "warning screen" threshold that forces users to enter intentionally. These elements combine to create psychological depth rather than a traditional interface. Furthermore, I try to present the information in a logical and organized way. I use visual elements like size, color, and alignment to draw attention to key features and group related items together, which helps users process information efficiently.

    <p>The feedback the user receives through audio operates differently than visual feedback. Visually, they can see the pupils directly follow the location of the cursor in real time, and the spawned eyes fade and disappear gradually. This continuous response makes user actions feel consequential. On the other hand, the sound feedback confirms the user knows that they are "in" the experience without drawing their attention to it. When the user interacts by clicking or moving, there is no change in sound, and that is by design. The absence of sound in response to interaction is feedback in itself: the forest still exists without regard for the user. They are simply observers in an autonomous system, not controlling it.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, information design provides the audience with information regarding hierarchy and emotions. The low-frequency music serves to give an audio base layer that could be read as heavy and ominous. This audio base layer communicates danger or mystery without explicit messaging. In addition, the oscillator layer contributes a higher pitch texture that is so light it would become dull on its own, but it works together with the base layer. The combination establishes an emotional tone: it is not an entirely pleasant forest, it is unsettling. The core challenge is that audio needs to be present enough that users would notice it exists, but subtle enough that it never dominates. Use it too boldly and it becomes annoying. Use it too quietly and it provides nothing. Moreover, making clicks and cursor movement silent create a psychological depth. Users unconsciously register that their actions don't affect the soundscape, which helps maintain the narrative that they are visitors not controllers. In addition, the larger pupils located in the center clearly establish primacy while the smaller ones can indicate something of more secondary attention. Besides, white pupils imposed against pure black create the maximum contrast design for readability. 
    </p>
    <p>The mapping in this experience is different, in an unexpected UI pattern. In most interactive experiences, sound is used as positive reinforcement. For example, clicking would provide options or digitally fruitful responses. However, this audio experience does not use any type of reward sound. This mapping communicates that the user is not in control of the forest; it exists with or without them. The eyes following the cursor indicate the same behavior as eyes in the real world, when people will be followed if they make a noise in a very quiet place. Clicking to spawn eyes is one of the game interaction patterns. This visual representation of mental models has a user-friendly design style with very little need for player tutorial.

        In the prototype, the central eye stayed still and only followed the cursor when the mouse was pressed. In the final assessment, the central eye was emphasized through rigid centering and followed the cursor even when the mouse was not pressed. It is a major success to me because it creates a focal point that makes the experience feel like interaction with a conscious being rather than a scattered swarm.

    </p>
    <p>What I found most challenging is also the one that I am most proud of. I implement the mechanism that constrains pupils within eye sockets while following the cursor. I create a non-linear response: subtle when the cursor is far, snap-to-attention when the cursor is close. That interaction makes the UI feel alive. To achieve it to run smoothly, each constraint needed to be tested several times.

    <p>This project illustrated that immersion and interaction are not mutually exclusive. By inhibiting user agency through clear affordances and predictable mechanics, it can create space for more meaningful choices. The design works not through visual complexity but through coherent purpose, every aspect of the design reinforces the primary narrative of interactive observation. In the end, all layers of experience felt living, mysterious, and responsive to presence. Audio design often acts as a form of decoration in interactive experiences, but in this work, it functions as the psychological foundation. The success of this project did not depend on what sounds were chosen, but rather what sounds were omitted, which created a space for absence to speak as loudly as presence. The outcome is an experience in which the visual and audio layers work together in tension rather than harmoniously, generating a sense of discomfort that drags the user deeper into immersion.
